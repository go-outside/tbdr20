Refactor Roll20 objects into Tbdr20 namespace and pull global use functions into new script Tbdr20

Call !move for tokens in turn order



"be aware that Roll20 may throttle your use of state."

Handle duplicate condition assignment (keep longest duration)

right click 'add turn' -- add in middle of turn for mistake
track on gm layer

track on( 'destroy:graphic', handle... ) rather than purging turn order

on 'end-combat' add combat time to calendar? or update calendar to have combat round precision
probably need per round precision in calendar for case of effects with duration extending beyound the combat
maybe time is rounded up to nearest minute when combat ends

What does chat command /direct do?
