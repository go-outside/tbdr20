Report remaining conditions and durations to GM at end of participant turns


on 'end-combat' add combat time to calendar? or update calendar to have combat round precision
probably need per round precision in calendar for case of effects with duration extending beyound the combat
maybe time is rounded up to nearest minute when combat ends

What does chat command /direct do?
