elevation / flight / dynamic lighting
See One-Way Dynamic Lighting
Different color lines for different heights?

spell line of sight / blast dimension / point of origin tool
mounts
consider setting no-wrap to calendar effects durations in display table
move -- allow multiple movers for a token?

consider prompt to start round? if advanced. Cannot bring up pop-up. It would have to be in chat

Low priority:
Tongues -- can language proficiencies be pulled from character sheets?

Zero priority:
New feature: deploy party onto map
!fc -- whisper player response 

Notes:
Hold shift while pinging to focus everyone's view on that spot
"be aware that Roll20 may throttle your use of state."


Handle duplicate condition assignment (keep longest duration)

track on( 'destroy:graphic', handle... ) rather than purging turn order

on 'end-combat' add combat time to calendar? or update calendar to have combat round precision
probably need per round precision in calendar for case of effects with duration extending beyound the combat
maybe time is rounded up to nearest minute when combat ends

What does chat command /direct do?
