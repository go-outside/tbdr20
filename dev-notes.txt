It appears as ifn Campaign.get( 'turnorder' ) does not change if one of its items is remove from play
interestingly the turn order window reflects the removal from page. It is just the api data that is not purged

open TO on !combat
close TO on !combat clear
Report remaining conditions and durations to GM at end of participant turns
on advance or announce turn, ensure turnOrder[ 0 ] is still present before acting

on 'end-combat' add combat time to calendar? or update calendar to have combat round precision
probably need per round precision in calendar for case of effects with duration extending beyound the combat
maybe time is rounded up to nearest minute when combat ends

What does chat command /direct do?
