Refactor Roll20 objects into Tbdr20 namespace and pull global use functions into new script Tbdr20

Call !move for tokens in turn order

New feature: deploy party onto map

!combat consider re-enabling the arrow on initiative page
!combat refactor usage of state condition records -- copy records to temporary, modify, store temporary records -- as with calendar effects
  !combat purgeConditionRecord should take array and record id? then splice array and disabled token markers

!move refactor usage of mover state -- copy records to temporary, modify, store temporaries -- as with calendar effects

!fc -- whisper player response 


"be aware that Roll20 may throttle your use of state."

Handle duplicate condition assignment (keep longest duration)

right click 'add turn' -- add in middle of turn for mistake
track on gm layer

track on( 'destroy:graphic', handle... ) rather than purging turn order

on 'end-combat' add combat time to calendar? or update calendar to have combat round precision
probably need per round precision in calendar for case of effects with duration extending beyound the combat
maybe time is rounded up to nearest minute when combat ends

What does chat command /direct do?
